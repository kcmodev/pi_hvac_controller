# Automatic HVAC Air Freshener

<p>Uses a Raspberry Pi and Google's Nest API to detect when the HVAC unit is operating. When the HVAC unit is determined to be operating, via an API call, the Pi actuates
 a motor spraying an air freshener can into the return duct onto the air filter. This results in air freshener being dispersed throughout
 the entire house every time the air conditioner runs.</p>
