# Automatic HVAC Air Freshener

<p>Uses a Raspberry Pi with a PIR motion sensor to detect airflow moving through an HVAC duct. When airflow is detected the Pi actuates
 a motor spraying an air freshener can into the return duct onto the air filter. This results in air freshener being dispersed throughout
 the entire house every time the air conditioner runs.</p>
